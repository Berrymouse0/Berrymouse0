- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Berrymouse0
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AI about Nature Language part.
- I know a little bit of Blender and Unity. Because I learned them with Udemy. \
- But I am not learning now because of the College major, Computer Science.
- So I want to focus on learning program languages like Python, Java, C, etc... at least for now.
